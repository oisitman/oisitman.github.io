  abstract = {In this paper, we report a cooperative manipulation method for non-contact robotic electromagnetic needle manipulation system.
   We employ two 3 degrees of freedom (DOF) robotic electromagnetic needles to achieve an over-actuated manipulator, which can move the particle 
   to any position in the planar workspace from any direction. The redundant DOFs, combined with an optimization-based control approach, enable 
   the manipulator to achieve accurate path following and avoid the collision of needles. Using visual servoing, the developed controller can 
   achieve line following accuracy of 0.33±0.32 μm, square following accuracy of 0.77±0.55 μm, and circle following accuracy of 0.89±0.66 μm 
   with a 4.5 μm diameter superparamagnetic particle. The manipulator can also manipulate a particle along complex paths such as infinity 
   symbol and letter symbols.},

  abstract = {Modeling the dynamic of tool-tissue interaction for the robotic minimally 
  invasive surgeries is one of the main issues for designing appropriate robot controllers. 
  A mobile measurement device is produced in order to model some nasal tissues of a human. 
  This mobile device is a hand-held one which measures the applied moments and relative angular 
  displacements about a fixed pivot point. The ex-vivo measurements are realized by surgeons on 
  a relatively fresh human cadaver head. The tip of the nose and the nasal concha are the two 
  tissues that are investigated. In this study, five different viscoelastic models are considered; 
  Elastic, Kelvin-Voight, Kelvin-Boltzmann, Maxwell and Hunt-Crossley. The results are evaluated 
  and cross-validated on each data set. Hunt-Crossley and Kelvin-Boltzmann models provided the
   minimum root-mean-square (RMS) error among the other models.},

  abstract = {With the advancement of technology, robots have begun to be utilized in numerous medical applications,
   including minimally invasive surgery. This use aims to address the disadvantages of traditional open surgery procedures. 
   This thesis contributes to a research project titled “Robot-assisted endoscope control that can be manipulated by 
   surgical tools (NeuRobo-Scope),” which focuses on minimally invasive endoscopic surgery of the pituitary gland tumor. 
   During this procedure, a robot handles the endoscope as it maneuvers within the human nasal cavity. The movement of 
   the endoscope is restricted by soft tissues. Another operational scenario involves the surgeon manually repositioning
   the endoscope by directing the robot that holds the endoscope.
   This thesis addresses two central research challenges: (1) the interaction between the surgeon and the robot, and (2)
   the interaction between the robot and soft tissue.
   Firstly, the dynamics of the interaction between the surgeon and the robot are explored. 
   The effects of various compliant controller parameters are examined using a non-backdrivable experimental setup with a 
   single degree of freedom. A specific task is outlined to quantitatively assess the impact of these parameters on 
   energy efficiency and accuracy.
   The second research challenge centers on modeling human nasal tissue to design a 
   more precise controller. To gather data from human cadavers, a novel hand-held measurement device has been developed. 
   External forces, moments, and soft tissue models are derived from ex-vivo experiments. Once the soft tissue models are
   identified, a revised interaction control method is proposed for the teleoperated endoscope holder robot. The surgical procedure in focus is tested with this newly proposed interaction controller using a single-degree-of-freedom experimental setup.
   The experiments conducted with the proposed controllers have proven successful for the outlined operational scenario. 
   The results indicate the feasibility of motion control for surgical robots operating within constrained environments.},

  abstract = {Magnetic manipulation of particles at close vicinity is a challenging task. 
  In this paper, we propose simultaneous and independent manipulation of two identical 
  particles at close vicinity using two mobile robotic electromagnetic needles. 
  We developed a neural network that can predict the magnetic flux density gradient 
  for any given needle positions. Using the neural network, we developed a control 
  algorithm to solve the optimal needle positions that generate the forces in the 
  required directions while keeping a safe distance between the two needles and particles. 
  We applied our method in five typical cases of simultaneous and independent microparticle 
  manipulation, with the closest particle separation of 30 μm.},

  abstract = {In the design of kinesthetic haptic devices, there are mainly 
  impedance type and admittance type device. In a customary scenario, the 
  human operator back-drives the haptic device by holding and providing
   motion to the handle of the haptic device. If the type of transmission 
   system does not allow passive back-drivability, then the back-drivability 
   is satisfied by the use of an admittance controller. This type of a haptic 
   device is said to have admittance structure. The selection of the admittance 
   term in this controller plays a critical part in the task execution performance. 
   Determination of this term is not trivial and the optimal parameters depend on not 
   only the key performance criteria but also on the human operator. An experimental study 
   is carried out in this work to determine the effect of the admittance term parameters on 
   the performance of human operators in terms of the energy efficiency and the best accuracy. 
   In this paper, the experimental set-up and the results of the experiments are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {Robotic magnetic manipulation offers a minimally invasive approach to gastrointestinal 
  examinations through capsule endoscopy. However, controlling such systems using 
  external permanent magnets (EPM) is challenging due to nonlinear magnetic interactions, 
  especially when there are complex navigation requirements such as avoidance of sensitive 
  tissues. In this work, we present a novel trajectory planning and control method incorporating 
  dynamics and navigation requirements, using a single EPM fixed to a robotic arm to manipulate an 
  internal permanent magnet (IPM). Our approach employs a constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator 
  that considers the dynamics of the IPM to generate optimal trajectories for both the EPM and IPM. 
  Extensive simulations and real-world experiments, motivated by capsule endoscopy operations, demonstrate 
  the robustness of the method, showcasing resilience to external disturbances and precise control under 
  varying conditions. The experimental results show that the IPM reaches the goal position with a maximum 
  mean error of 0.18 cm and a standard deviation of 0.21 cm. This work introduces a unified framework for
   constrained trajectory optimization in magnetic manipulation, directly incorporating both the IPM's 
   dynamics and the EPM's manipulability.},
